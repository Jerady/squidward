Java Advanced Imaging (JAI)
-----------------

The source code for the jai-core project is licensed under the Java Research License (JRL) for non-commercial use. The JRL allows users to download, build, and modify the source code in the jai-core project for research use, subject to the terms of the license.

The source for the jai-core project is also licensed for commercial use under a new no-fee Java Distribution License (JDL). The JDL allows commercial use of Java Advanced Imaging with or without modification, as long as compatibility with the entire API Specification is maintained. This includes passing the TCK tests for Java Advanced Imaging, and retaining the javax namespace as defined by the JCP.

Other future projects will be licensed under terms defined by the particular sub-project.


JDOM
-----------------

JDOM is available under an Apache-style open source license, with the acknowledgment clause removed. This license is among the least restrictive license available, enabling developers to use JDOM in creating new products without requiring them to release their own products as open source. This is the license model used by the Apache Project, which created the Apache server. The license is available at the top of every source file and in LICENSE.txt in the root of the distribution.


PostgSQL
-----------------

PostgreSQL's source code is available under the most liberal open source license: the BSD license. This license gives you the freedom to use, modify and distribute PostgreSQL in any form you like, open or closed source. Any modifications, enhancements, or changes you make are yours to do with as you please. As such, PostgreSQL is not only a powerful database system capable of running the enterprise, it is a development platform upon which to develop in-house, web, or commercial software products that require a capable RDBMS. 


PostgSQL JDBC Driver
-----------------

The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is distributed under the BSD license, same as the server. The simplest explanation of the licensing terms is that you can do whatever you want with the product and source code as long as you don't claim you wrote it or sue us. You should give it a read though, it's only half a page.
